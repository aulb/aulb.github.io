I also want to learn new (relative to me) technologies such as Elixir (and Phoenix framework), React Native, and get better grasp at Redux. I decided to remake my old Pokemon visualization app in Elixir+Phoenix+React and quickly realized that trying to apply TDD to new projects with new language ended up being a huge unnecessary hurdle.</p>\n<p>Its tenfold better to take things step by step, right from the start. Learning new concepts by bridging from familiar territories. I took a major step back. I\'m most familiar with Python but have yet mastered the ways of Django/Flask. So this is a good starting point to help me make better connection to Phoenix. Next would be to actually do small exercises (like Leetcode/Hackerrank problems) in Elixir. Get comfy with Elixir scripting.</p>\n<h1>Personal standup and reflection everyday</h1>\n<p>Two weeks passed by </p>\n<h1>Supercharging ST3</h1>\n<p>I\'m gonna try to catalogue the steps.
