*This page is under continuous edits* A little organized note for my future self and anyone that might find this useful. Ideas about what to say in a software engineering interview. In addition Gayle's book, I find glossing over potential behavioural questions is a good way to not get tripped up. Will try to migrate this carousel style in the next few weeks. 

# Work + Company Culture
- ‚ùì What do you look for in your next company (in terms of people, office)

Probably good to say things related to their culture. Show that you're ambitious and looking for the same. Startup related answers: small team, learning opportunities, making big impact, watching a product grow from start to finish. Bigger companies: leadership opportunities.

- ‚ùì How did you hear about this company, how did you hear about this position
- ‚ùì What are the job factors you look for when you're looking to apply here
- ‚ùì How does this company fit into your career goals
- ‚ùì Tell me about a time where you revolutionize the way something is done (work/school)
- ‚ùì What do you bring to the team or company
