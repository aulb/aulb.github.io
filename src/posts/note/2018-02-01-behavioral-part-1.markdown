*This page is under continuous edits* A little organized note for my future self and anyone that might find this useful. Ideas about what to say in a software engineering interview. In addition Gayle's book, I find glossing over potential behavioural questions is a good way to not get tripped up. Will try to migrate this carousel style in the next few weeks.
