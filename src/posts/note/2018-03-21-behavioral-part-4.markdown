- ❓ When can you start work
- ❓ What is your expected salary
- ❓ What is your current salary

Was asked this question once. Not giving a current salary is probably a good answer, adding 3 - 5% of current salary is also a good way to not disclose your real salary. What the recruiter want at the end of the day is just data.

- ❓ What is your highest degree
- ❓ Are you eligible to work in {country}?

This question is often asked as a simple yes or no. For Canadians, I read a 'lifehack' that suggest answering yes to this because its easy to get a TN visa. I would not recommend this and actually answer no. 

- ❓ Are you currently interviewing with other places
- ❓ Which companies are you interviewing at? What stages?
