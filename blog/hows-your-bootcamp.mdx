# "Hows your <strike>bootcamp</strike>?"
Not a -bootcamp-

The couple weeks since I started hanging out at <a href="https://recurse.com">Recurse Center</a> with the goal of coming out as a better programming. 

# Doing things step by step
One of the many goals that at Recurse was to start TDD-ing new projects I do. I also want to learn new (relative to me) technologies such as Elixir (and Phoenix framework), React Native, and get better grasp at Redux. I decided to remake my old Pokemon visualization app in Elixir+Phoenix+React and quickly realized that trying to apply TDD to new projects with new language ended up being a huge unnecessary hurdle.

Its tenfold better to take things step by step, right from the start. Learning new concepts by bridging from familiar territories. I took a major step back. I'm most familiar with Python but have yet mastered the ways of Django/Flask. So this is a good starting point to help me make better connection to Phoenix. Next would be to actually do small exercises (like Leetcode/Hackerrank problems) in Elixir. Get comfy with Elixir scripting.

# Personal standup and reflection everyday


Two weeks passed by 
# Supercharging ST3 
I'm gonna try to catalogue the steps. Moved to OS X 10.12 after years of being stuck in 10.9. First step ofcourse is to download ST3.

## Install Package Control
For all things.

## Install Babel
For JSX, react specific highlights.

## Install ESLint

- Done
