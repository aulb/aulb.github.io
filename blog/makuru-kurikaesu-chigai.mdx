「まくる」と「繰り返す」
Today I saw a new verb まくる. It means to do things constantly or over and over.
I also know a verb that has similar meaning 繰り返す, which means to do things repeatedly.

So what is the difference?
食べまくる 
To eat non-stop. As in cannot stop eating. Imagine you fasted the last three days and now you cannot stop eating.
Generally with this verb, the nuance is negative.

食べ繰り返す
To eat repeatedly. Implies some sort of break in between. So eating, then stop, then eat again, repeatedly.
